"React Storybook is a UI development environment for your React components. With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

React Storybook runs outside of your app. So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements."

React Storybook should be a proper solution to the problem of developing React components in isolation and setting props based on ENV. 

Intalling Storybook:

```
npm i -g @storybook/cli
getstorybook
```

The guide for using Storybook with React can be found here (this requires customization):
```
https://storybook.js.org/basics/guide-react/ 
```

"Storybook has its own Webpack setup and a dev server. Webpack setup is very similar to Create React App, but allows you to configure as you want."
